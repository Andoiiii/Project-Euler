# Project Euler
I'm gonna do them

---
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) seems to be a website that has bunch of math problems on it, but really it seems to be more about algorithms and computations. I'm gonna do them. But for fun, I'm gonna do them in a different language for each one. 
### Process
I currently know these languages:
- C
- Racket/Scheme/Lisp
- Java
- Javascript
- Python

I just pick one that I feel would be fun to use and use it. No real logic.
But yeah, we'll see how it goes.
