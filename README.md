# Project Euler
I'm gonna do them

---
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) seems to be a website that has bunch of math problems on it, but really it seems to be more about algorithms and computations. I'm gonna do them. But for fun, I'm gonna do them in a different language for each one. 
### Process
I currently know these languages:
- C
- Racket/Scheme/Lisp
- Java
- Javascript
- Python

I shall pick one at random for each PE question, and do it in that language (and paradigm...)
We'll... see how it goes. Maybe I'll add more to the roulette wheel in the future?
