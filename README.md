# Project Euler
I'm gonna do them

---
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) seems to be a website that has bunch of math problems on it, but really it seems to be more about algorithms and computations. I'm gonna do them. But for fun, I'm gonna do them in a different language for each one. 
### Process
I currently know these languages:
- C/C++
- Racket/Scheme/Lisp
- Java
- Javascript
- Python

I just pick one that I feel would be fun to use and use it. No real logic.
> Please forgive my lack of attention to C. I just look at it and think, "I'm going to have to define array methods and then deal with C strings to parse the input etc" and at that point am I really doing the problem or am I just solving a meta problem??? I just want to solve math problems not debug segfaults thank you very much
But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

### Stats
- Problems Done: 16
- Problems Done in Racket: 5
- Problems done in Java: 3
- Problems done in Javascript: 3
- Problems done in Python: 5
